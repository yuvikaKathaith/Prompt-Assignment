Generate a modern, clean, fully responsive Navigation Bar using semantic HTML and TailwindCSS.

Follow these rules strictly:
- Do NOT add <html>, <head>, or <body>.
- Output ONLY the navbar section.
- Use a max-w-7xl container centered with px-6.
- Include: brand name (text logo), nav links, and a mobile hamburger menu.
- Use flexbox for layout.
- Desktop: links visible.
- Mobile: links hidden and replaced with a slide-down menu.
- Use Tailwind classes: flex, items-center, justify-between, space-x-8, py-4, hidden, block, md:hidden, md:flex.
- Use smooth hover transitions.
- Use a clean font with good spacing.
- Make sure the mobile menu animates simply (show/hide with JS snippet).
- Use Heroicons inline SVG for hamburger (menu) and X (close) icons.
- Color theme: white navbar, dark text, subtle shadow.

Brand name:
- Use a simple text brand like “PromptCraft”.

Return only the final HTML + the minimal JS needed for mobile toggle.
